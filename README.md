## üîπ MoreStats

**MoreStats** is a personal project I started to improve my skills in fullstack development. It focuses on global champion statistics using data from the Riot Games API.

> **Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è Paused ‚Äì Some UI components are being reused in the Statistships project.

### üéØ Objectives

#### Technical Goals
- Fetch and analyze match data from the Riot Games API.
- Display general champion statistics (win rate, pick rate, ban rate, etc.).
- Apply UI design principles using **MUI**, build responsive layouts.

#### Learning Goals
- Improve fullstack skills with **React + TypeScript** and **FastAPI**.
- Structure a full web app with clean architecture and reusable components.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, MUI
- **Backend (planned):** FastAPI, PostgreSQL

### üöß Features in Progress

- [x] Champion list page with sorting
- [x] Champion detail page ‚Äì layout
- [x] Champion detail page ‚Äì logic & design
- [ ] Champion list design improvements
- [ ] Backend implementation
- [ ] Riot API integration (live data)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Requirements

You need a **PostgreSQL** database.  
Create a `.env` file in `/backend` with the following content:

```env
POSTGRES_USER=your_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
POSTGRES_DB=your_db
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your_user:your_password@localhost:5432/your_db
PYTHONPATH=./backend
```
Then install dependencies and run the backend:
```
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
### 1. Backend Requirements
