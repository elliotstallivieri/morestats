# MORE STATS

**More Stats** is a personal project I started to improve my skills in web development, with a focus on React and working with public APIs.

**Current status:** Work in progress – the frontend is under development. The backend will follow once the main interface is functional.

## Goals

### Application
- Use the Riot Games API to fetch and analyze match data from League of Legends
- Display champion statistics such as win rate, pick rate, and ban rate

### Personal Development
- Practice fullstack development using React (frontend) and FastAPI (backend)
- Explore clean architecture and UI design principles (MUI, responsive design, etc.)

## Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + MUI
- **Backend (planned):** FastAPI + PostgreSQL

## Features in Progress
